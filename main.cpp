Inheritance and Polymorphism

Description: a hierarchy of citizens that inherit functions from a base class.
Another derived class that inherits from both the citizen and wolf base class.
Citizens can pay taxes and speak.
Werewolves can howl and growl from the wolf base class and speak and pay taxes from the citizen base class.
