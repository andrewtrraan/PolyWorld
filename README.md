# Polymorphism


Implemented nheritance and polymorphism with 8 various classes. Use of classes through various unique character messages depending on the actions the classes decide to do. Each class has a unique message but only some classes can perform actions such as pay taxes. A

The classes were written in separate .h header and .cpp source files. A variety of classes were implemented such as, Citizen, Wolf, Vamppire, Nobbs, Zombie, Troll, Dwarf and bat. Some classes such as the werewolf could inehrit from two classes which were the human and both class and is a unique feature to C++ to inherit from multiple classes. 

Warning:this project was originally developed with the CodeBlocks IDE and may not be compatible with other IDEs (not thoroughly tested).

For running the program, you should unzip the "PolyWorld.zip" folder. With CodeBlocks, the .cbp file can be opened and executed to run the program. The .h and .cpp files contained in the zip folder have also been shown separately to allow easy accessibility to the code, without the need for downloading the zip folder and interest in executing the program.
